    <p>
      â€™m an AI Engineer passionate about building intelligent systems that connect AI, robotics, and automation. Currently working at PanaceaLogics, Iâ€™ve led projects in computer vision, voice AI, and LLM-based chatbots, turning research-driven ideas into real, scalable solutions.
    </p>

    <p>
     Recent focus: developing AI voice agents (Twilio + ElevenLabs + FastAPI), autonomous interviewers using VAD and open-source voice models (Kokoro TTS, FT5), and RAG-powered chatbots with LangFlow, ChromaDB, and OpenAI embeddings. I also worked on stereo vision systems for aquaculture, estimating fish length and biomass using AI-driven image processing.
    </p>

    <p>
      I bring a mix of R&D depth and hands-on development experience â€” from cloud deployment to integration with APIs and workflow tools like n8n and LangFlow. My goal is to keep learning, evolving, and applying AI to solve real-world problems in robotics, automation, and intelligent systems ðŸ¤–.
